#### Pigeon Hole
In this file, we have stated the statement of the Pigeon Hole theorem and solved one problem. Then we write some simple codes in Sagemath to analyze the problem.
#### Stirling Number of 2nd kind
Here, we have discussed the uses of Stirling Number of the 2nd kind. Along with the definition, we have just informed some wonderful properties and two recurrence relation which is satisfied by the Stirling number of 2nd kind. Also, we have found another direct formula using the Inclusion-Exclusion formula, except for those recurrence relations. Then we found the Stirling number of the 2nd kind for a list of numbers using every formula. We have also calculated the time for all the numbers separately for all the formulae. Finally, we plotted the time taken in each case for all the numbers given in the list. We have reached a conclusion to tell which formula is good. 
#### Bell Number
Here, we have discussed what is Bell's number. It is nothing but all the partitions of numbers {1,2,...,n}. This Bell number formula is in terms of the Stirling number of the 2nd kind. Also, there is a recursive formula for this Bell number also. So, here also we have taken the rule that we will calculate the Bell number using both of the formulae and calculate the time for individual times. 
#### Multisets
In this script, we have also talked about the concept of multisets. What is it and how can you find multisets for a given set?
