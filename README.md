### Pigeon Hole
In this file, we have stated the statement of the Pigeon Hole theorem and solved one problem. Then we write some simple codes in Sagemath to analyze the problem.
### Stirling Number of 2nd kind
Here, we have discussed the uses of Stirling Number of the 2nd kind. Along with the definition, we have just informed some wonderful properties and two recurrence relation which is satisfied by the Stirling number of 2nd kind. Also, we have found another direct formula using the Inclusion-Exclusion formula, except for those recurrence relations. Then we found the Stirling number of the 2nd kind for a list of numbers using every formula. During this calculation, we have also calculated the time for all the numbers separately for all the formulae. Finally, we have plotted the taken time in each case for all the numbers given in the list. We have reached a conclusion to tell which formula is good.
